  "body": "# Ancient Athens\r\n### Athens was the largest and most powerful Greek state. It was a city with lots of beautiful public buildings, shops and public baths. The people of Athens lived below the Acropolis (rocky hill). The marble Parthenon, a temple, (see picture above) was built on the highest part of the Acropolis.\r\n## Farming\r\n### Farming in ancient Greece was difficult due to the limited amount of good soil and cropland. It is estimated that only twenty percent of the land was usable for growing crops. The main crops were barley, grapes, and olives. Grain crops, such as barley and wheat, were planted in October and harvested in April or May\r\n## Wars\r\n### The War fought between the two leading city-states in ancient Greece, Athens and Sparta. Description: The Peloponnesian War (431-404 B.C.) took place between the Athenian empire and Peloponnesian league lead by the Spartans. The Peloponnesian league was a coalition of the Thebes, Corinth and Sparta.\r\n## houses\r\n### Most Greek houses were small, with a walled garden or yard in the middle. The house was made of sun-dried mud brick. Mud houses crumbled away in a few years, and had to rebuild. So archaeologists do not dig up the ruins of Ancient Greek homes.\r\n![](http://factfile.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ancient-Greek-Homes-Pic.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
